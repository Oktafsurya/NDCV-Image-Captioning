    "### Task #1\n",
    "\n",
    "Begin by setting the following variables:\n",
    "- `batch_size` - the batch size of each training batch.  It is the number of image-caption pairs used to amend the model weights in each training step. \n",
    "- `vocab_threshold` - the minimum word count threshold.  Note that a larger threshold will result in a smaller vocabulary, whereas a smaller threshold will include rarer words and result in a larger vocabulary.  \n",
    "- `vocab_from_file` - a Boolean that decides whether to load the vocabulary from file. \n",
    "- `embed_size` - the dimensionality of the image and word embeddings.  \n",
    "- `hidden_size` - the number of features in the hidden state of the RNN decoder.  \n",
    "- `num_epochs` - the number of epochs to train the model.  We recommend that you set `num_epochs=3`, but feel free to increase or decrease this number as you wish.  [This paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.03044.pdf) trained a captioning model on a single state-of-the-art GPU for 3 days, but you'll soon see that you can get reasonable results in a matter of a few hours!  (_But of course, if you want your model to compete with current research, you will have to train for much longer._)\n",
    "- `save_every` - determines how often to save the model weights.  We recommend that you set `save_every=1`, to save the model weights after each epoch.  This way, after the `i`th epoch, the encoder and decoder weights will be saved in the `models/` folder as `encoder-i.pkl` and `decoder-i.pkl`, respectively.\n",
    "- `print_every` - determines how often to print the batch loss to the Jupyter notebook while training.  Note that you **will not** observe a monotonic decrease in the loss function while training - this is perfectly fine and completely expected!  You are encouraged to keep this at its default value of `100` to avoid clogging the notebook, but feel free to change it.\n",
    "- `log_file` - the name of the text file containing - for every step - how the loss and perplexity evolved during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're not sure where to begin to set some of the values above, you can peruse [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.03044.pdf) and [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.4555.pdf) for useful guidance!  **To avoid spending too long on this notebook**, you are encouraged to consult these suggested research papers to obtain a strong initial guess for which hyperparameters are likely to work best.  Then, train a single model, and proceed to the next notebook (**3_Inference.ipynb**).  If you are unhappy with your performance, you can return to this notebook to tweak the hyperparameters (and/or the architecture in **model.py**) and re-train your model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 1\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** Describe your CNN-RNN architecture in detail.  With this architecture in mind, how did you select the values of the variables in Task 1?  If you consulted a research paper detailing a successful implementation of an image captioning model, please provide the reference.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** \n",
    "To perform the image captioning task of this project, we are using CNN-RNN architecture where CNN acts as encoder to extract features from the input image whereas RNN acts as decoder to generate caption based on the given features of the encoder. Detailed information about the architecture used is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Encoder: we used the pre-trained model `resnet50` from ` torchvision`. This architecture uses CNN as the basic block. As far as we know CNN is the state of the art for image-based tasks. So we can extract good and useful features from the image using an architecture with CNN. We have to change the linear layer in `resnet50` to match our output size. We can do this using `nn.Linear (resnet.fc.in_features, embed_size)`. The size of the classifier layer output at `resnet50` that we use must match the size of the embedding layer in our decoder.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The Decoder: There are 3 layers in our decoder: embedding layer, LSTM layer and linear layer. Initially the encoder output features will be fed to the decoder embedding layer then the results from the embedding layer will be fed to the LSTM. We will use the Teacher Forcer method to train LSTM where at t = 1 we use the features from the encoder, and at t = 2,3,4 and so on we use the word from the groundtruth caption as input to the LSTM. LSTM is used because from the core course it is said that LSTM outperforms vanilla RNN. LSTM can handle longer dependency information. Finally, the LSTM output will be fed to the linear layer to get the highest probability output word. For Decoder, we used `embed_size = 256` and `hidden_size = 512` referring to the paper. Vocabulary count threshold is chosen to be 4 in order to igore infrequently shown words.\n",
    "\n",
    "### (Optional) Task #2\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that we have provided a recommended image transform `transform_train` for pre-processing the training images, but you are welcome (and encouraged!) to modify it as you wish.  When modifying this transform, keep in mind that:\n",
    "- the images in the dataset have varying heights and widths, and \n",
    "- if using a pre-trained model, you must perform the corresponding appropriate normalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 2\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** How did you select the transform in `transform_train`?  If you left the transform at its provided value, why do you think that it is a good choice for your CNN architecture?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** \n",
    "For the `transform_train` I only used the transform given in the 2nd notebook.\n",
    "```\n",
    "transform_train = transforms.Compose([ \n",
    "    transforms.Resize(256),                          # smaller edge of image resized to 256\n",
    "    transforms.RandomCrop(224),                      # get 224x224 crop from random location\n",
    "    transforms.RandomHorizontalFlip(),               # horizontally flip image with probability=0.5\n",
    "    transforms.ToTensor(),                           # convert the PIL Image to a tensor\n",
    "    transforms.Normalize((0.485, 0.456, 0.406),      # normalize image for pre-trained model\n",
    "                         (0.229, 0.224, 0.225))])\n",
    "```\n",
    "The `transform_train` is composed by some transformation.\n",
    "1. `RandomCrop(224)` is used because  we are using `resnet50` and based on https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/torchvision/models.html `resnet50` expect input images has 3-channel RGB with shape (3 x H x W), where H and W are expected to be at least 224. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. `Resize(256)` is used to auguments training image data so that the model can be trained on more dataset\n",
    "3. We normalize the training image so it's values has a range of [0, 1] and also we following the normalization value that suggested by Pytorch documentation. The documentation said \"... normalized using mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406] and std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]\". In fact this value is the same value used in the ImageNet Dataset and all torchvision pretrained models for image classification task, including `resnet50` are trained using this data set\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task #3\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, you will specify a Python list containing the learnable parameters of the model.  For instance, if you decide to make all weights in the decoder trainable, but only want to train the weights in the embedding layer of the encoder, then you should set `params` to something like:\n",
    "```\n",
    "params = list(decoder.parameters()) + list(encoder.embed.parameters()) \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 3\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** How did you select the trainable parameters of your architecture?  Why do you think this is a good choice?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** \n",
    "For the encoder, because we changed the classifier layer `resnet50` so we have to train all the trainable parameters of our new encoder classifier layer. We don't train the rest of the layers in our encoder because those layers already use the pre-trained weights from `torchvision`.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the decoder, because we built it from scratch so we have to train the entire network layer. In other words, we have to train all the trainable parameters in our decoder\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task #4\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, you will select an [optimizer](http://pytorch.org/docs/master/optim.html#torch.optim.Optimizer).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 4\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** How did you select the optimizer used to train your model?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** \n",
    "For the optimizer, I used Adam with the laerning rate = 0.001, beta1=0,9, beta2=0.99 and epsilon=10E-8.\n",
    "`torch.optim.Adam(params, lr=0.001, betas=(0.9, 0.999), eps=1e-08)`. Why did I choose Adam? based on the article at this link https://machinelearningmastery.com/adam-optimization-algorithm-for-deep-learning/ there are some advantages of using Adam:\n",
    "1. Adam realizes the benefits of both AdaGrad and RMSProp.\n",
    "2. Using initial value of the moving averages and beta1 and beta2 values close to 1.0 (recommended) result in a bias of moment estimates towards zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "I set the value of learning rate, beta1, beta2 and epsiolon by following the recomendation from those link. And I found that the training result with `batch_size = 128` is looked good. The training loss can reach 1.7819, while perplexity can reach 5.94128"

For now, we strongly encourage you to train your model for the suggested 3 epochs without worrying about performance; then, you should immediately transition to the next notebook in the sequence (**3_Inference.ipynb**) to see how your model performs on the test data.  If your model needs to be changed, you can come back to this notebook, amend hyperparameters (if necessary), and re-train the model.\n",

    "To assess potential overfitting, one approach is to assess performance on a validation set.  If you decide to do this **optional** task, you are required to first complete all of the steps in the next notebook in the sequence (**3_Inference.ipynb**); as part of that notebook, you will write and test code (specifically, the `sample` method in the `DecoderRNN` class) that uses your RNN decoder to generate captions.  That code will prove incredibly useful here. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you decide to validate your model, please do not edit the data loader in **data_loader.py**.  Instead, create a new file named **data_loader_val.py** containing the code for obtaining the data loader for the validation data.  You can access:\n",
    "- the validation images at filepath `'/opt/cocoapi/images/train2014/'`, and\n",
    "- the validation image caption annotation file at filepath `'/opt/cocoapi/annotations/captions_val2014.json'`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The suggested approach to validating your model involves creating a json file such as [this one](https://github.com/cocodataset/cocoapi/blob/master/results/captions_val2014_fakecap_results.json) containing your model's predicted captions for the validation images.  Then, you can write your own script or use one that you [find online](https://github.com/tylin/coco-caption) to calculate the BLEU score of your model.  You can read more about the BLEU score, along with other evaluation metrics (such as TEOR and Cider) in section 4.1 of [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.4555.pdf).  For more information about how to use the annotation file, check out the [website](http://cocodataset.org/#download) for the COCO dataset."
